===== Introduction =====
////////////////////////

Thank you for purchasing VectoRaith's Medieval Arabian Buildings Tileset Pack!
The pack contains 16x16 px tilesets and 2 different resizes: (32x32 and 48x48 px)
Each resize is placed in their respective folder for convenience.
There is also an animated, 3-frames fountain sprite included.


In this pack, there are 3 main contents (A-C):

A. Main Tileset

Main tileset refers to main asset intended to be sold independently for this pack (i.e: vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_1.png, vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_2. png, etc.). In most cases, main tileset does not require special set up . What you need is only set the tile size, set the collision, then start placing the tiles into the map.

Based on the number in their last name, there are currently 6 types of Main Tileset:
1. Town Buildings Set A ---- Also known as Buildings Set 1. It contains Small House, Shop, Tavern, and Blacksmith building, as well as basic items needed to build a simple town. This set is non-modular.
2. Town Buildings Set B ---- Also known as Buildings Set 2. It contains Government Building/City Hall, Medium House, Watch Tower, Small Tower, and Worship building, as well as extension for the items in Basic Set A. This set is non-modular.
3. Two-story Buildings Set ---- Also known as Buildings Set 3. It contains semi-modular two-story buildings in various designs that you can adjust or use as is, as well as customizable shop planks and sometimes, chimney and roof corners.
4. Palace Building Set ---- Also known as Buildings Set 4. Basically a thematic expansion for Buildings Set 2. It contains a giant Palace building as well as independent Watch Tower and two special, one-collision-tile Trees. This set is non-modular.
5. Fort and Tower Building Set ---- Also known as Buildings Set 5. It contains two gigantic buildings (Fort and Tower). This set is non-modular.
6. Fishing Village Set ---- Also known as Buildings Set 6. It contains a shop buildings and an all-purpose building (warehouse, maybe?), as well as fishing village infrastructures. Buildings in this set is non-modular.

B. Autotiles

Autotiles are tiles specifically made for certain engines that support "auto-tiling". Every autotiles in my release is always a rare and special case, you can always regard it as "free demo" prior to final release. Engine I currently supported is RPG Maker series (sans RPG Maker XP) 

C. Sprites

Sprites are animated pixel art corresponding to specific tiles. There are two types of Sprites in my creations: 1. Objects and 2.Characters. Objects always have !$ in their start of filename and set up for 3 frames. Each row represents one facing direction (down, left, right, and up), but can be exploited to represents one kind of object. Characters are always released in 8-character spritesheet format unless under special circumstances.


//////////////////////
===== How to Use =====
//////////////////////

Tileset usage and set up depend heavily on the game engine used. Due to incredible amount of tileset mapping engines available, please refer to tileset set up tutorial for each engine.

Main tileset PNGs are compatible with all if not most engines, e.g. RPG Maker, Godot, Unity, Tiled, etc.

Bonus autotile pack is currently only tested and compatible for:

RPG Maker VX and VX Ace (32x32 px)
RPG Maker MV (48x48 px)
RPG Maker MZ (all sizes)
Keep in mind that only RPG Maker XP and MZ that support transparent Wall and other autotiles

If you want to use Tiled for auto-tiling, due to current incompatibility, of course the autotileset need to be adjusted manually

////////////////////////
===== Swappability =====
////////////////////////

By default and unless used in modular manner (e.g you don't use the building design as is), assets in this pack is always swap-compatible for other VectoRaith's Buildings series, 

example:

vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_1.png is always swappable  with vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_modern_1.png. 

Please refer to their respective filename and layout when swapping.
