===== Introduction =====
////////////////////////

Thank you for purchasing VectoRaith's Buildings Tileset Pack - Generic Medieval!
The pack contains 16x16 px tilesets and 2 different resizes: (32x32 and 48x48 px)
Each resize is placed in their respective folder for convenience.
There is also animated, 3-frames fountain/pond sprite included.

In this pack, there are 3 main contents (A-C, see below):

A. Main Tileset

Main tileset refers to main asset intended to be sold independently for this pack (i.e: vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_1.png, vectoraith_tileset_16x16_buildings_wooden_2. png, etc.). In most cases, main tileset does not require special set up . What you need is only set the tile size, set the collision, then start placing the tiles into the map.

Based on the number/letter in their last name, there are currently 7 types of Main Tileset:
0. Infrastructure Set ---- Zeroth asset. It does not contain Buildings at all, but this is where your town will stand. It contains alternative placement of the big pond that is also available in Buildings Set 1.
1. Town Buildings Set A ---- Also known as Buildings Set 1. It contains Small House, Shop, Tavern, and Blacksmith building, as well as basic items needed to build a simple town with their respective architecture. This set is non-modular.
2. Town Buildings Set B ---- Also known as Buildings Set 2. It contains Government Building/City Hall, Medium House, Watch Tower, Small Tower, and Worship building, as well as extension for the items in Basic Set A. This set is non-modular.
3. Two-story Buildings Set ---- Also known as Buildings Set 3. It contains semi-modular two-story buildings in various designs that you can adjust or use as is, as well as customizable shop planks and sometimes, chimney and roof corners.
4. Palace Building Set ---- Also known as Buildings Set 4. It contains a gigantic palace building, as well as common palace complex details in Buildings Set 2 plus new trees with narrower trunk, make it possible to do only 1 collision tile. This set is non-modular.
5. Fort and Tower Building Set ---- Also known as Buildings Set 5. It contains a fortress and a tower. It is non-modular, but in some architectures you can set the tower height.
6. Fishing Village Set ---- Also known as Buildings Set 6. It contains a shop buildings and an all-purpose building (warehouse, maybe?), as well as fishing village infrastructures. Buildings in this set is non-modular.

B. Terrain Autotiles
Autotiles are tiles specifically made for certain engines that support "auto-tiling". Terrains are available in the 3x3 autotile format (a.k.a 47-tile format) as well as RPG Maker-compatible autotile for RPG Maker VX and above. In the 3x3 autotile format, you can animate the water terrain with 3-frames animation, similar to the format used in the RPG Maker autotile.

C. Sprites

Sprites are animated pixel art corresponding to specific tiles. There are two types of Sprites in my creations: 1. Objects and 2.Characters. Objects always have !$ in their start of filename and set up for 3 frames. Each row represents one facing direction (down, left, right, and up), but can be exploited to represents one kind of object. Characters are always released in 8-character spritesheet format unless under special circumstances. 

!!! If you use plugin to manually shift/tilt a sprite in RPG Maker, please make sure you delete the "!" in the sprite name before use! !!!

D. Modularity
Modularity means the ability to customise building by replacing its module (part). Buildings Set 3 in this pack is semi modular, meaning you can customize your buildings under some limitations. Modular and semi-modular assets in VectoRaith is fully swappable with other VectoRaith assets of the same category. This way you can avoid monotonous building style across your game!


//////////////////////
===== How to Use =====
//////////////////////

Tileset usage and set up depend heavily on the game engine used.

!!! Due to incredible amount of tileset mapping engines available, please learn the engine by yourself first and refer to tileset set up tutorial for each engine !!!!

Main tileset PNGs are compatible with all if not most engines, e.g. RPG Maker, Godot, Unity, Tiled, etc.

RPG-Maker specific autotiles are currently only tested, and compatible for:

RPG Maker VX and VX Ace (32x32 px)
RPG Maker MV (48x48 px)
RPG Maker MZ (all sizes)
Keep in mind that only RPG Maker XP and MZ that support transparent Wall and other transparency autotiles


////////////////////////
===== Swappability =====
////////////////////////

By default and unless used in modular manner (e.g you don't use the building design as is), assets in this pack is always swap-compatible for other VectoRaith's Buildings series, 

example:

vectoraith_tileset_buildings_wooden_1.png is always swappable  with vectoraith_tileset_buildings_modern_1.png. 

Please refer to their respective filename, size, and layout when swapping.
